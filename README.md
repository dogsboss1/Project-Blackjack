My 'secret app' - basically my personal app for small personalised stuff.

My hopes were for it to be this awesome personalised app that could cater for all my needs but the time Vs reward is ridiculous.
Anyway the idea is that it would open to the cliche calcualtor where it would then respond to a password. From there I would customize it, making for a great reminders app :P

So far it hasnt gotten past the calculator ;(
